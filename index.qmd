## Overview

This group study investigates the factors influencing Airbnb pricing within the context of the evolving vacation rental market. Recognizing Airbnb's significant role in accommodating travelers, particularly amidst ongoing periods of high inflation, this research analyzes the impact of property characteristics, amenities, location, and neighborhood safety on listing prices. Utilizing data from Washington D.C., Boston, and Chicago, the analysis seeks to identify patterns that enable travelers to optimize their choices based on cost, comfort, and safety considerations.

Furthermore, this project addresses the strategic investments made by many hosts striving for "Superhost" status, a designation earned based on stringent performance criteria. The research aims to provide actionable insights for both guests and hosts. For guests, the objective is to enable informed decision-making regarding affordability, amenities, and safety. For hosts, the goal is to identify strategies for maximizing returns through optimized property features and pricing. Key research questions include: (1) identifying the primary drivers of Airbnb pricing; (2) comparing pricing strategies of Superhosts and regular hosts; (3) analyzing city-specific price variations; (4) assessing the impact of neighborhood crime rates on pricing; and (5) evaluating the influence of proximity to city centers.

## Methods

**Independent Samples t-Tests:** These tests were employed to determine whether statistically significant differences exist between the means of two independent groups. Specifically, t-tests were used to evaluate the impact of Superhost status on mean listing price, testing the null hypothesis that there is no difference in mean listing prices between Superhost and non-Superhost listings. A p-value below the significance level of 0.05 indicates rejection of the null hypothesis.

**Analysis of Variance (ANOVA):** ANOVA was utilized to compare the means of more than two groups and determine if statistically significant differences exist among at least one group mean. This method assesses whether observed sample means provide sufficient evidence of differences in population means. ANOVA produces an F-statistic, representing the ratio of between-group variance to within-group variance, and an associated p-value. A high F-statistic and a p-value below 0.05 indicate rejection of the null hypothesis of equal means across all groups.

**Tukey's Honestly Significant Difference (HSD) Post Hoc Test:** Following significant ANOVA results, Tukey's HSD test was conducted to perform pairwise comparisons between group means and identify specific differences. In this study, Tukey's HSD was used to analyze relationships between listing price and neighborhood/ward, listing price and neighborhood/ward crime rates, listing price and distance to city centers, and listing prices across the three cities.

**Correlation Analysis:** This method was used to assess the linear relationship between two continuous variables, producing a correlation coefficient ranging from -1 to 1. A positive coefficient indicates a positive correlation, while a negative coefficient indicates a negative correlation. The strength of the correlation is interpreted as strong for coefficients between -1 and -0.5 or between 0.5 and 1, and weak for coefficients between -0.5 and 0.5. In this project, correlation analysis was used to examine the relationship between host response rate and rental listing price.

**Chi-Square Tests of Independence:** These tests were conducted to evaluate the association between two categorical variables. The test compares observed and expected frequencies to calculate a chi-square statistic and an associated p-value. A p-value below 0.05 indicates a statistically significant association between the variables and rejection of the null hypothesis of independence. In this project, chi-square tests were employed to determine if an association exists between Superhost status and room type.

## Summary of Results

This analysis examined key factors influencing Airbnb pricing, including neighborhood/ward, distance to city center, Superhost status, and crime rates in Washington D.C., Boston, and Chicago. Neighborhood and proximity to the city center were identified as primary determinants of price. Superhost status demonstrated a moderate impact on pricing in Washington D.C., but a less pronounced effect in Boston and Chicago, suggesting the need for further investigation. While crime rates exhibited statistically significant differences in mean rental prices across categories, additional research is warranted to confirm their direct influence. Host response rate did not emerge as a significant predictor of price. Comparative analysis across cities revealed that Washington D.C. exhibited the lowest median price and the highest prevalence of outliers, Chicago demonstrated the highest median price and price dispersion, and pairwise city comparisons revealed statistically significant, although modest price differences.

These findings offer valuable insights for both travelers and hosts in the Airbnb marketplace. Travelers can leverage this analysis to make informed decisions balancing affordability, amenities, and safety. Hosts can utilize these findings to optimize pricing strategies by emphasizing impactful property features, gaining Superhost status, and investing in properties closer to high traffic, tourist-centric areas. While inter-city price differences were relatively small, Washington D.C.'s prevalence of luxury rentals positions it as a prominent destination for high-end travelers. This study underscores the importance of understanding local market dynamics to enhance the Airbnb experience for both guests and hosts.
